# About

This project serves as a lightweight reference implementation for several small
utility APIs. It is intentionally simple so that the code can be studied and
extended with minimal overhead.

The repository includes a basic [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) app
with in-memory storage. It is **not** intended for production but provides a
clean starting point for experimentation.
