U-DAO Official API & Docs Site.



# Why?

A FastAPI based API designed to be actually useful.

This is a challenge to myself to use AI as little as possible.
Upon reviewing the code, you may see some overly commented snippets. Yes, i used AI for the tedious parts, but not before learning how they worked, and then got some practice first.
